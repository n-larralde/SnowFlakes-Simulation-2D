# SnowFlakes-Simulation-2D

Summary: This was part of a global optimization process where you have to spawn as much snowflakes as possible.

Initial statement: At the begining of the program, it can handle about 5000 particules max.
Final result: On the last versio fo the program it can handle more than 500k particles.

Controls: 
* Arrow keys to move the 'character'
* Use num right 1-9 keys to change the numbers of particles. You may want to change the number of particles so that it runs smoothly on your computer, to do this you need to change the presets values associated to the num keys manually in the Globals.h file.
